                <p>If you want to lose fat, build muscle, or maintain your weight, you need to understand one fundamental concept: how many calories your body burns daily.</p>

                <p>This number—your TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure)—is the foundation of all nutrition planning. Get this right, and everything else becomes significantly easier. Get it wrong, and you'll spin your wheels wondering why your diet isn't working.</p>

                <p>Let's break down how many calories you actually burn, and more importantly, how to use that number to reach your goals.</p>

                <h2>The Two Components of Daily Calorie Burn</h2>

                <p>Your total daily energy expenditure consists of two main components:</p>

                <h3>1. BMR: Basal Metabolic Rate</h3>

                <p>Your Basal Metabolic Rate is the number of calories your body burns at complete rest, just to maintain basic functions: breathing, circulating blood, cell production, maintaining body temperature.</p>

                <p>It's the calories you'd burn if you stayed in bed all day.</p>

                <p>BMR depends on:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Body weight:</strong> Heavier people burn more calories at rest (more mass to maintain)</li>
                    <li><strong>Height:</strong> Taller people typically have higher BMR</li>
                    <li><strong>Age:</strong> BMR decreases about 2% per decade after age 20</li>
                    <li><strong>Sex:</strong> Men typically have higher BMR than women (more muscle mass)</li>
                    <li><strong>Genetics:</strong> Some people are naturally faster or slower metabolizers</li>
                </ul>

                <p>You can't change your BMR much, but you can change the other component:</p>

                <h3>2. Activity Factor (NEAT + Exercise)</h3>

                <p>Beyond your resting metabolism, you burn calories through:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Exercise:</strong> Running, lifting, sports, intentional training</li>
                    <li><strong>NEAT (Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis):</strong> Walking, fidgeting, cleaning, working. This is surprisingly significant—it can add hundreds of calories daily.</li>
                    <li><strong>Thermic Effect of Food (TEF):</strong> Calories burned digesting food (about 10% of intake)</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Your activity level determines your TDEE multiplier. Someone sedentary might burn 1.2x their BMR. Someone training hard might burn 1.7x or more.</p>

                <h2>Calculating Your TDEE: The Formula</h2>

                <p>The most accurate formula for BMR is the Mifflin-St Jeor equation:</p>

                <div class="callout tip">
                    <div class="callout-title">Mifflin-St Jeor Formula</div>
                    <p><strong>For Men:</strong> (10 × weight in kg) + (6.25 × height in cm) − (5 × age) + 5</p>
                    <p><strong>For Women:</strong> (10 × weight in kg) + (6.25 × height in cm) − (5 × age) − 161</p>
                    <p>Then multiply by your activity factor (1.2 to 1.9)</p>
                </div>

                <h3>Example: A 30-year-old male, 180 lbs, 5'10"</h3>

                <p><strong>Step 1: Convert to metric</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Weight: 180 lbs = 81.6 kg</li>
                    <li>Height: 5'10" = 178 cm</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Step 2: Calculate BMR</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>BMR = (10 × 81.6) + (6.25 × 178) − (5 × 30) + 5</li>
                    <li>BMR = 816 + 1112.5 − 150 + 5 = <strong>1783.5 calories</strong></li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Step 3: Apply activity factor</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If moderately active (exercise 3-5 days/week): 1783.5 × 1.55 = <strong>2,764 calories/day</strong></li>
                </ul>

                <p>This person's TDEE is approximately 2,764 calories per day.</p>

                <div class="callout info">
                    <div class="callout-title">Activity Level Multipliers</div>
                    <ul style="margin-left: 0; padding-left: var(--spacing-lg);">
                        <li>Sedentary (little exercise): BMR × 1.2</li>
                        <li>Lightly active (light exercise 1-3 days/week): BMR × 1.375</li>
                        <li>Moderately active (exercise 3-5 days/week): BMR × 1.55</li>
                        <li>Very active (intense exercise 6-7 days/week): BMR × 1.725</li>
                        <li>Extremely active (physical job + training): BMR × 1.9</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <h2>Why TDEE Matters More Than You Think</h2>

                <p>Your TDEE is the pivot point for everything:</p>

                <h3>To Lose Fat</h3>

                <p>Eat fewer calories than your TDEE. The deficit creates weight loss. The bigger the deficit, the faster the loss—but also the greater the risk of losing muscle.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Aggressive cut (500 cal deficit): ~1 lb/week loss</li>
                    <li>Moderate cut (250 cal deficit): ~0.5 lb/week loss (more sustainable)</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Our example person eating 2,264 calories (500 deficit) would lose approximately 1 lb per week.</p>

                <h3>To Build Muscle</h3>

                <p>Eat more calories than your TDEE, then lift heavy. The surplus provides energy for training and building new tissue.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Moderate surplus (250 cal): ~0.5 lb/week gain (mostly muscle if training hard)</li>
                    <li>Aggressive surplus (500 cal): ~1 lb/week gain (more fat included)</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>To Maintain Weight</h3>

                <p>Eat at your TDEE. Simple, but requires precision.</p>

                <h2>The Catch: TDEE Is a Guess (But a Good One)</h2>

                <p>Here's the reality: calculating TDEE is an educated guess. No formula is 100% accurate because metabolism varies individually.</p>

                <p>Two people with identical stats might have different actual TDEEs. Genetics, hormones, gut bacteria, and other factors matter.</p>

                <p><strong>This is why tracking is essential.</strong></p>

                <div class="callout warning">
                    <div class="callout-title">The Verification Step</div>
                    <p>Calculate your TDEE, eat at that level for 2-3 weeks, then track what happens. If you're losing weight when you shouldn't be, your actual TDEE is lower. If you're gaining, it's higher. Adjust accordingly.</p>
                </div>

                <h2>Practical Tips for Using Your TDEE</h2>

                <h3>1. Start With Your Calculated TDEE</h3>

                <p>Use the formula above or our TDEE calculator. Don't overthink it—it's a starting point, not gospel.</p>

                <h3>2. Pick a Deficit or Surplus</h3>

                <p>For fat loss, -250 to -500 calories is ideal. For muscle building, +250 to +500 calories. Going bigger creates faster results but more challenges (hunger or unwanted fat gain).</p>

                <h3>3. Track Your Food for 2-3 Weeks</h3>

                <p>Use an app like MyFitnessPal, Cronometer, or even pen and paper. You need to verify your actual intake matches your plan.</p>

                <h3>4. Monitor Your Body</h3>

                <p>Weekly weigh-ins and progress photos. If results don't match expectations after 3 weeks, adjust calories by 100-200.</p>

                <h3>5. Prioritize Protein</h3>

                <p>Aim for 0.7-1g per pound of body weight daily. It preserves muscle during cuts and supports muscle building during bulks.</p>

                <h3>6. Be Patient</h3>

                <p>Fat loss and muscle building take time. A 250-calorie deficit leads to 0.5 lbs/week loss—13 lbs in 6 months. Sounds slow, but it's sustainable and you won't lose muscle.</p>

                <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>

                <p>Your TDEE is the foundation of nutrition planning. Without knowing it, you're guessing. With it, you can:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Create the right deficit to lose fat without losing muscle</li>
                    <li>Build muscle by eating enough to support growth</li>
                    <li>Stop yo-yo dieting and understand what actually works</li>
                    <li>Make informed decisions about your nutrition</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The formula isn't perfect, but it's accurate enough to point you in the right direction. From there, real-world feedback tells you if you need to adjust.</p>

                <p>That's how the best diet in the world works: it's based on your actual calorie needs, tailored to your goals, and adjusted based on real results.</p>
